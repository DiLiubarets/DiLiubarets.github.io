### **Excel Automation Playground**



In my role, I regularly prepare a detailed report that tracks inventory and sales data. This report includes critical metrics like product costs, shipping details, and cost of goods sold (COGS) across multiple customers and products. Initially, this was a manual process that required extensive data extraction, filtering, calculations, and formatting. Each report update was time-consuming and left room for human error. Recognizing these challenges, I aimed to develop an automated solution to streamline the process.
