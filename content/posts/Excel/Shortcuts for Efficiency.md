I’ve found that using Excel shortcuts is an excellent way to enhance my workflow and boost efficiency. By incorporating shortcuts into my daily tasks, I’m able to navigate, edit, and format data much faster. This has allowed me to focus more on complex analysis and problem-solving, rather than spending time on repetitive actions. It’s been a game changer in improving how I work with data!
