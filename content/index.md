title: Welcome to my world!

As a **lawyer** and **full-stack developer**, I thrive on blending deep analytical thinking with creative problem-solving. My legal expertise allows me to navigate complex issues with precision, while my skills in JavaScript and Python empower me to design innovative, tech-driven solutions. From data analysis to business strategy, I approach every challenge with a logical mindset and a passion for delivering impactful, real-world results.

Coding:
```python
future = []
def add(element):
	future.append(element)
def build():
	print("The future is not a place we're going to, but one we're creating!")
add("optimism")
build()
```
And  
**Excel** isn’t just a tool for me; it’s a playground for creativity and problem-solving. 
I am a data-driven professional with expert-level Excel skills, turning raw data into clear, actionable insights through advanced reporting and automation. From interactive dashboards to complex data analysis, I use Excel to simplify workflows and unlock powerful solutions.
